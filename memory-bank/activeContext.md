# Job Tracker - Active Context

## Current Focus

### Project Phase: Initial Setup
We are at the beginning of the project, setting up the foundation for the Job Tracker desktop application. The focus is on establishing the core architecture and development environment.

### Active Tasks
1. Project initialization
   - Repository setup
   - Development environment configuration
   - Core dependency installation

2. Architecture implementation
   - Electron main process setup
   - React application structure
   - Database schema creation
   - jobs-data integration for job source
   - Supabase integration for cloud sync

3. Core features
   - Local database setup
   - Basic UI components
   - Job synchronization with jobs-data
   - Authentication flow

## Recent Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. **State Management**: Chose Zustand over Redux for its simplicity and better integration with React Query
2. **Database**: Selected better-sqlite3 for robust offline-first capabilities
3. **UI Framework**: Opted for TailwindCSS for rapid development and consistent styling
4. **Build Tool**: Selected Vite for faster development experience
5. **Job Data Source**: Using jobs-data as the primary source for job applications

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Data Flow**: Implementing repository pattern for data access
2. **Background Services**: Using node-cron for scheduled tasks
3. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with custom error types
4. **Component Structure**: Atomic design pattern for UI components
5. **Data Source**: Integration with jobs-data for job application ingestion
